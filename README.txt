Dhananjay Portfolio - README

What's included:
- index.html : Single-page portfolio with GSAP animations, SVG Preloader, particles, 3D parallax, video lightbox, skills, timeline, testimonials, contact form fallback (mailto) and WhatsApp link.
- style.css  : Additional CSS (Tailwind used via CDN in index.html).
- script.js  : Small helper file and placeholder for further modularization.
- icons/     : Placeholder folder for software icons (premiere.png, aftereffects.png, photoshop.png, illustrator.png, corel.png, davinci.png)
- profile.jpg : Replace with your real photo.
- To deploy: Upload all files to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your hosting).

Notes on contact form:
- Current behavior: Opens user's email client using mailto: with prefilled subject and body.
- For "fully working" email sending without relying on client's email app, connect a backend endpoint or use EmailJS / Formspree. I can add direct EmailJS integration if you want (requires EmailJS user ID & template ID).

Need help:
- If you want, I can replace placeholder images with your real assets, add EmailJS details, or prepare a GitHub repo with CI deploy steps.
